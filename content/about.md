## About

I'm a Full‑Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building cloud‑native services and modernizing legacy systems. I deliver accessible front‑end experiences and scalable, maintainable backends. UX is my passion.

I'm a [CICS Alumnus](https://cics.umass.edu) from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

### What I do
- **Innovation & AI:** Deliver forward-thinking solutions. Leverage AI tools to accelerate delivery while maintaining security, code quality, and long‑term maintainability.
- **Frontend & UX:** Focus on user needs. Design and ship accessible, testable, component‑driven interfaces.
- **Cloud & Microservices:** Build resilient, scalable systems that run reliably in serverless and traditional environments.
- **Delivery & DevEx:** Improve productivity and release reliability via CI/CD, quality gates, and developer tooling.
