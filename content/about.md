## About

I’m a Full‑Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years building cloud‑native services and modernizing legacy systems. I deliver polished, accessible front‑end experiences and scalable, maintainable backends for high‑performance environments. User Experience (UX) is my passion, and the user always comes first.

I'm a [CICS Alumnus](https://cics.umass.edu) from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

### What I do
- **Innovation and AI:** Deliver forward‑thinking solutions by leveraging AI development tools to accelerate delivery and increase output while maintaining security, code quality, and long‑term maintainability.
- **Frontend & UX:** Design and ship component‑driven, accessible interfaces with predictable state and testable components.
- **Cloud & Microservices:** Build resilient, scalable and efficient systems that work seamlessly in any intended environment (serverless or otherwise).
- **Delivery & Developer Experience:** Improve developer productivity and release reliability through CI/CD, automated quality gates, and tooling that reduces deployment friction.
