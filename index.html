                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a junior at the UMass College of Computer and Information Sciences persuing a BS in CS for 2020. In 2017, I interned at Charles River Interactive, a digital marketing company located outside of Boston. I also am a collegiate athlete, having rowed competitively for almost 11 seasons. I am a huge baseball fan, and have recorded a full length rock album and an EP within the last year with intentions on releasing another this summer.</p>

                    <p>I chose Computer Science because I want to be the most well rounded designer I can be. I view the world through the lens of a designer, but with formal training as a software engineer I can help with the whole stack. I also have interests in machine learning, and believe that it is the future of development.</p>
