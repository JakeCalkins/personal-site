# TODO

- Calm background (Use the same colors as the Zen browser frontpage or Claude)
- Lighter font for subheading and footer
- Better scaling for small browsers (right now, phone sizes do not work well)
- Better buttons or LinkedIn, GitHub and Email (switch to using icon only, circular, monocromatic and minimalist)
- Move the style tags and embedded font for EB Garamond to the CSS file


## Later 
- Cleanup from the linkedin stuff (less verbose)
