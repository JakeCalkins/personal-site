# Project TODO & Roadmap

Phase 4 Tasks
- [ ] Update the README
- [ ] Add tooltips on hover to the icons in the top right in desktop view
- [ ] Reduce generated filesize in dist/ and generated directory size.
- [ ] Improve performance and page load speed across the board. Improve build times.
- [ ] Add logic so anytime a new markdown file is added to the content/ folder, a new page is generated and linked on the index.html homepage. New page links should exist as text links in the title div, right justified directly adjacent to the Jake Calkins title. On small browser views, they should be added as buttons in the FAB menu.
- [ ] Fix alignment issues on FAB, LinkedIn Icon and the Headers
