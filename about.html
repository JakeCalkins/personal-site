            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Passionate and dedicated student attending University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Computer Science with experience in supporting SEO operations through tasks such as content research and optimization recommendations for clients of a digital marketing agency. Professional skills also include data analysis, PPC and Social Media support, and web analytics. Moreover, I thrive in fast-paced environments that require a sense of flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to comb through large quantities of data. </p>

            <p>I have a passion for design as well, from user experience to user interface design, industrial design and general graphic design. I enjoy building solutions and experiences that are not just beautiful but functional as well. My biggest hobby is music, which has provided me with skills in some industry standard programs from the audio and video world, which combined with my design passion and love for programming give me a well rounded skillset.</p>
                    
            <p>Years of rowing experience have given me the toolset of a leader, project manager and someone who can be dependable and can time manage school, work and several practices a day starting from before sunrise. This, on top of vast food industry experience, has also shown my devotion to success and drive to better not just myself but my peers.</p>
